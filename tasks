 - Compare with previous project that David pushed already
 - Create docker image using the `Dockerfile` from the base image of `python:alpine`.
 - Create docker-compose yaml stack file
    - use mysql:5.7
    - input init.sql configurations
    - pull the image of the app from the AWS ECR repository.
    - deploy the app for each swarm nodes using `global` mode.
    - run the app on `port 80`

Infrastructure:

- create cfn template to deploy the app into Docker containers
- docker containers which are 3manager + 2worker
- we need role for accessing ECR
- we will use aws cli2 for pull/push from ECR
- docker, awscli2, git, docker swarm, Amazon ECR credential helper
